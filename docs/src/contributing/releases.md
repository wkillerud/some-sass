# Releasing new versions

This document describes how to release a new version of Some Sass.

A new release typically involves two assets:

- The [language service package][lsnpm] is published to `npm`.
- The Visual Studio Code extension is published to:
  - [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SomewhatStationery.some-sass)
  - [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/SomewhatStationery/some-sass)

## Conventional Commits

We use [nx] to version and tag the language service module based on [conventional commits][conventional].

nx reads the commit messages to determine what the new version should be, and to generate changelogs. Which version is released depends on how you write the commit message.

## Release process

To start a new release, run `node .scripts/release.mjs`. This script:

1. Gets the latest `main` branch with `git checkout main && git pull`.
2. Runs `npm clean-install`.
3. Runs `npm run release` which updates versions, generates changelogs and Git tags.
4. Pushes the changes and tags with `git push && git push --tags`.

GitHub Actions does the actual publishing when there are new tags.  Create a [new GitHub release](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass/releases/new?title=some-sass-language-server@x.y.z) for the latest tag.

The script continues to:

1. Update the dependency on the server in `vscode-extension/package.json`.
2. Bump the version number of the extension.
3. Run `npm install` to update the lockfile.
4. Commit the changes and run `git tag some-sass@<version from package.json>`.
5. Run `git push && git push --tags`.

Again, GitHub Actions is does the actual publishing (including GitHub release) when there are new tags.

### Manual release process

In case `npm run release` fails, or GitHub Actions can't publish, here's how you can release manually (provided you have access).

To prepare the repository:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull
npm clean-install
npm run build
npm run test:all
```

Then, in `packages/language-server`:

```sh
# run npm version first if nx failed
npm publish
```

In `vscode-extension/`:

```sh
vsce package
```

Then log in to and publish manually via Visual Studio [Marketplace], [Open VSX] and GitHub Releases (attach the `.vsix` file to the release).
