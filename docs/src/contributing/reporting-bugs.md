# Reporting bugs

If you discover something is wrong or unexpected as you're using Some Sass,
it's helpful to create a minimal reproduction of the issue.

A minimal reproduction is a Sass workspace that has only enough code to demonstrate the issue.
Having a minimal reproduction in a new project helps to confirm that this is a repeatable problem,
and is not caused by something else in your development environment or project.

Sharing a minimal reproduction is often required when filing a bug report.

## Create a Sass workspace with our template repository

If you can reproduce the issue with a single file, a code snippet included as part of the issue is fine. If not, you can [use this template repository on GitHub](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass-issue-template) to quickly set up a minimal reproduction.

## Create an issue

If the bug can be reproduced, then it is time to [create an issue and file a bug report](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass/issues/new/choose).

Remember to include the link to your minimal reproduction. Please also include step by step instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

## Want to help fix the problem?

It can be daunting to jump in, but it's also a very rewarding feeling to improve your own tools. If you're up for it, volunteer to send a pull request. You can always change your mind later, just let us know that you need someone else to try.

You can learn how to set up the development environment and more later on in the Contributing section of this documentation.
