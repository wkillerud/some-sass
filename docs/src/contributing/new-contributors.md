If you've never worked on Some Sass you're in the right place. There are several ways you can help:

- Share your setup in Discussions' [Show and tell](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).
- Help answer questions in [the Q&A section](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass/discussions/categories/q-a).
- Research [open issues](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass/issues) to find out what needs to be done.
- Improve this documentation, add screenshots or recordings.
- [Configure language clients](../language-server/getting-started.md) for more editors.
- Add unit tests or end-to-end tests where missing.
- Volunteer to fix bugs or add missing features.
- Support financially.

Have a look at [Writing documentation](./writing-documentation.md) if you want to work on the docs.

For code, you may want to start with the [architecture](./architecture.md), or primers on [extensions for Visual Studio Code](./extensions-for-vs-code.md) and the [Language Server Protocol](./language-server-protocol.md).
