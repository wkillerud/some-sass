# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing, be it to the language server, to the VS Code extension, the documentation, or in some other way ðŸŒŸ

The best place to get started is [the guide for new contributors](https://wkillerud.github.io/some-sass/contributing/new-contributors.html).

## Conventional commits

This repository uses [conventional commits and `semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work) to automatically publish changes merged to `main`.

Two assets are published:

- The language server is published to npm
- The VS Code extension is published to Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX
