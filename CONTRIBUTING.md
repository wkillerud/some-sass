# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing, be it to the language server, to the VS Code extension, the documentation, or in some other way ðŸŒŸ

The best place to get started if you're new here is to read the guide for new contributors.

### Debugging integration tests for the browser version

Like [debugging integration tests](#debugging-integration-tests), do this when you want to debug the tests themselves rather than functionality. The web integration tests compile to in `web/src/suite/`.

Set breakpoints in the compiled output (`web/dist/suite/index.js`).

At time of writing you may have to set the breakpoints after the debugger has attached. I've had the best success rate clicking repeatedly to set the breakpoint.

## Documentation

There's a documentation website in [`docs/`](./docs).

To preview the documentation on your machine you need [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html). If you're on macOS and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) you can `brew install mdbook`.

```sh
cd docs
mdbook serve --open
```

To learn how to work with an mdbook, head over to [the mdbook user guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/creating.html).

## Conventional commits

This repository uses [conventional commits and `semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work) to automatically publish changes merged to `main`.

Two assets are published:

- The language server is published to npm
- The VS Code extension is published to Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX

Keep both in mind when deciding whether a change is a patch, minor or major release.
