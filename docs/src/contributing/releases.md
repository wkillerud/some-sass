# Releasing new versions

This document describes how to release a new version of Some Sass.

## Conventional Commits

This repository uses [nx] to manage release

- The [language service package][lsnpm] is published to `npm`.
- The Visual Studio Code extension is published to:
  - [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SomewhatStationery.some-sass)
  - [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/SomewhatStationery/some-sass)

nx reads [conventional commits][conventional] to determine what the new versions should be, and to generate changelogs. Which version is released depends on how you write the commit message.

### Release process

To start a new release:

1. Get the latest `main` branch with `git checkout main && git pull`.
2. Run `npm clean-install`.
3. Run `npm run release`.
4. Push the changes and tags with `git push && git push --tags`.
5. Create a [new GitHub release](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass/releases/new?title=some-sass-language-server@x.y.z) for the latest tag.

GitHub Actions is configured to do the actual publishing when there are new tags.

Once the language server has been published to npm:

1. Update the dependency manually in `vscode-extension/package.json`.
2. Bump the version number of the extension.
3. Run `npm install` to update the lockfile.
4. Commit the changes and run `git tag some-sass@<version from package.json>`.
5. Run `git push && git push --tags`.

For the extension, GitHub Actions is configured to do the actual publishing (including GitHub release) when there are new tags.

### Manual fallback

For `npm` packages:

```sh
npm version [major|minor|patch]
npm publish
```

For the VS Code extension:

```sh
vsce package
```

Then publish manually via Visual Studio [Marketplace], [Open VSX] and GitHub Releases (attach the `.vsix` file to the release).
