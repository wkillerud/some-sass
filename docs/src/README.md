# Introduction

Some Sass is a language server for [SCSS][scss] using the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)][lsp]. There is an official extension for Visual Studio Code, and community contributed clients for other editors.

The language server is [published independently to npm][npm], and can be used with any editor that has an LSP client.
